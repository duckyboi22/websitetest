            <h1>The Archery Club</h1>
            <p>
                The Archery Club at Burnside High School offers a fun and focused environment for students interested in learning one of the world's oldest and most disciplined sports. It's the perfect opportunity to meet new people, as well as developing your aim and concentration, all while trying something new.
                Whether you're a complete beginner or already know how to shoot, the club supports all skill levels. Each session is designed to help you build your technique, from the basics of stance and form to improving your accuracy over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                The club fosters a positive and inclusive atmosphere where students encourage each other and learn together. Most members start with no prior experience and quickly discover how rewarding and enjoyable archery can be. It's not just about hitting the target but also personal growth, focus, and having fun along the way.
                Archery is also a great mental reset in the middle of the school day. It allows you to slow down, focus on one thing at a time, and experience the satisfaction of steady improvement.

            <h1>Costs</h1>
            <p>
                The Archery Club costs $13 per session each week, or $130 for a full 10-week term. If a session is cancelled (e.g., due to bad weather), it won't be charged, but please check the field for updates as emails may not always be sent. If no one is there, the session is cancelled.
            </p>
            <p>
                Please note that any missed sessions by you will still be charged.

            <h1>Location</h1>
            <p>
                The Archery Club meets on the main Burnside High School field, near the running track behind the swimming pool and over the bridge. However, the location may occasionally change due to weather or other school activities, so be sure to check around the field for any updates. If you're unsure, look for the group with the archery gear, or simply ask someone nearby.

            <h1>What To Expect</h1>
            <p>
                You don't need to bring a change of clothes. Just come in your regular school uniform. We recommend bringing a packed lunch because it saves time and lets you focus on enjoying the session instead of waiting in long canteen lines. You can eat during breaks at the archery range so feel free to pack something easy and mess-free.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most of our members are complete beginners when they join so don't worry if you've never held a bow before. The first session is designed to ease you in gently. We'll go over the basics of archery safety including how to handle the equipment correctly and what to watch out for when others are shooting. You'll also be introduced to basic posture and how to aim.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don't worry if the first session feels slow. The pace will pick up as you build on your skills. You'll have more time to actually shoot arrows, work on your technique, and set personal goals for improvement. Coaches will be there to offer guidance, help with form, and support your progress throughout the sessions.
